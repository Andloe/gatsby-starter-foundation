Many kinds of components are used in web page design. The main purpose of web pages is to transmit one or several messages to the Internet user, for which they must use suitable elements to achieve this objective. Images and text are the elements most used for the aforementioned transmission of ideas, although with the application of new technologies, other types of elements, such as sounds and videos, are gaining more and more strength. 

This transmission of ideas in images and text occurs in a totally different way. While the message or idea to be conveyed can be accessed much more quickly through images, the volume and depth of concepts that can be conveyed with written language in the same space is much greater, so both elements are necessarily complementary to achieve good communication. 

## Integration of text in web design

It is common to find on web pages a paragraph preceded by a graphic element, usually an image. This type of configuration is very effective and consists of drawing the user's attention to the graphic element and then completing the exposition of the idea using written language. Let's look at an example:

You will appreciate that the first thing that stands out in this design is each of the images arranged next to each text. However, in order to properly understand what is intended to be conveyed, after being seduced by the image, we must read the text that is next to it. 

Seen a page from the aesthetic point of view and, as a whole, the texts also behave as a graphic element, and have some attributes that they share with them, such as color, size and shape. It is very common for graphic elements such as images or photographs to have text as part of them. Taking all this into account, it is obvious that we should not consider the texts only as the method of developing an idea, but we should also include it in the design of the page from the graphic point of view. In ancient times, writing was formed by the representation of objects, and in many cases, such as the paintings and reliefs of ancient Egypt, writing was already part of the aesthetic design of many works of art. 

## Size, type, legibility and color of typography 

### Font Size: 

![size](/assets/alexander-andrews-zw07kvdahpw-unsplash.jpg "size")

The scale for determining font sizes has a history as long as the history of printing. In web design, as well as in the use of fonts in computer programs, the following types of scales are used to determine the size of fonts or fonts, as can be seen in the following [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-css-styles-to-html-with-cascade-and-specificity). In the same [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-css-styles-to-html-with-cascade-and-specificity) you can also see how other font attributes can be determined, such as font, color and weight. 

The correct determination of the size of the fonts is very important, both to obtain a good readability of the texts, and from an aesthetic point of view. There are many ways to set font sizes, but the most recommended is to set a font size for the entire page and then vary the size using percentages or ems. 

The most advisable measures for the texts are 11 points for the font and 13 points for the line spacing, since they provide a relaxed feeling when reading. 

### Font Type: 

![type](/assets/jon-tyson-x5bnzeywcug-unsplash.jpg "type")

Given the special characteristics of text display on monitors, there are some considerations to consider when establishing the types of fonts with which the texts on our website will be displayed. There is controversy among specialists about the type of font that is more readable. While some argue that serif fonts (Times New Roman or Georgia) are more readable, others, the majority, argue that sans serif fonts (arial, verdana, tahoma) are. 

The most convenient thing is to use a single font, or two, for the entire page and then modify its attributes, to be able to establish differences between the different types of text (headings, subheadings, paragraphs, etc.) that will be set on the page. On some occasions, since the design requires it, it is possible that more than one type of letters must be established, but even in this case it is advisable to limit the number of fonts used to a minimum. 

Note that browsers and operating systems support different fonts, so it will be necessary to set a font and some alternates. This is set in the CSS as follows: 

`font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; `

Note that each designated font must be separated from the others by a comma. By setting fonts in this way, if the browser doesn't find a font, it will set the next one. If the design calls for a certain typeface, the alternate should have similar characteristics. 

### Typography Legibility: 

![legible](https://images.websitebuilderexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/25014612/typography-bad-readability-example.png "legibility")

An important aspect of web design is the legibility of the texts, since the difficulty in reading them can make the visitor choose to leave the page. 

Generally, it is accepted that those fonts designed to improve legibility in printed texts are not suitable for web texts, since they contain elements that require higher resolutions than those offered by monitors. 

For this, some fonts have been designed that are particularly useful to be applied in the design of elements that are going to be displayed on monitors, including web pages. These typefaces are, for example, Tahoma, Verdana and Georgia, which allow easy reading even when using small sizes. 

### Typography Color: 

Typography color, although it must be integrated with the rest of the design, it must not reduce texts visibility. In order to obtain good readability of the texts published on a web page, the font colors must clearly contrast with background colors. Low contrast makes text difficult to read.

## Arrangement of texts on a web page:  

In those sites where long texts must be placed, it is convenient for it to be divided into short paragraphs, so that the user can make a quick tour of the text and not get "lost" easily.

It is also advisable to use different levels of titles `(<h1> <h2> <h3>, etc.)` to order the sequence of the texts, which also makes it easier for users to find those parts of the text that are the most attractive to them. 

The arrangement in paragraphs also serves as a decorative element. The inclusion of a large text can make the set lose aesthetics. The inclusion of titles and subtitles with fonts, sizes and colors different from the rest of the text, not only makes it easier and more pleasant to read, but also, by making correct use of these attributes, it collaborates in the embellishment of the page. 

Creating lists, either ordered/numbered `<ol>` or unordered/unnumbered `<ul>`, is also useful. Lists read very well on screen, are easy to scan and attract visitors' attention.
